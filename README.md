ðŸš€ Since 2019, I worked as a backend engineer for LAIX inc, an AI company in China that creates and delivers products and services to popularize English learning. The current work scene allows me to have a better understanding of technical frameworks such as database and message queue. At the same time, I also practice TDD and DEVOPS in my work.

ðŸ–Œ I like discussing technical topics with others, learn more technical knowledge or help others in this way. I am currently active on stackoverflow and [my blog](http://www.forcoding.club)

âœ¨ For fun, I like reading and playing football, as well as video games. On most weekday evenings, I will pour a glass of beer and open technical books to study for more than an hour. Then I will play Rainbow Six for another hour, although Iâ€™m still pretty good at the moment.
